# Vision Statement
INBA (INBA's Not a Banking App) is an app designed for those who spend money on a frequent basis, which tracks and analyzes spendings to advise towards a financially sustainable lifestyle and to optimize the saving/spending ratio.

## What is it?
This app serves as a primary location for the user to record and view their day-to-day spendings. 
The app acts as an easy to use and visually appealing alternative to a notepad or an excel sheet - which are some of the common methods for recording purchases. 
INBA also provides visualizations in the form of pie charts and graphs, so the user can easily pick out vital information at a glance. 
Through the use of statistical tracking, the app can recognize and indicate trends in the user's purchasing habits. 
With the addition of cloud functionality, the user can log in from any device to record or view their spendings. 

## Who are the users?
- The ideal demographic of this app includes those who spend money daily, perhaps on a wide variety of different services and products. 
- This app will benefit those record their spendings on a text file, Excel sheet or other file format. By switching to this app, their data will be easily viewable and parsable when compared to data on a basic file format. 
- This app will help those who would like to be more conscious with their spending habits. These people will benefit from the alerts that may pop up if they are too reckless with their spending. 
- People who prefer visual information as opposed to simple text will make good use of the information visuals that the app provides. 
- INBA aims to provide as much info and statistics as possible to the discerning spender, so they may make educated decisions on where their money should be going. 

## Why is this project valuable?
The entire world is currently recovering from an economic recession. 
The cost of living has risen a non-negligible amount, primarily due to rising inflation and increased demand from a restless population who is ready to move on from lockdown. 
Now is not a bad time to learn how to manage your spendings. \
On a less serious note, saving money is an important life skill that everyone should know. A penny saved is a penny earned, since we do not want to spend more than we earn. It also helps to have a safety net in the form of a money stockpile, in case things go wrong. \
If this is something that you struggle with, then this app will assist you on your journey to becoming an ideal money saver. 

## What are the success criteria?
- Provide the user as much information and statistics as possible about their spendings.
- Provide visualizations of data in the form of pie charts, graphs, etc. 
- Warn of any bad spending habits that may be developing. 
- Provide simple financial calculations for the user (how long until I should buy this thing, how long can I subside off this much money, etc). 
- Basic cloud functionality.
